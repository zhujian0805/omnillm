# providers Specification

## Purpose
Defines supported upstream provider types and instances, credential persistence, model discovery, execution, and provider compatibility behavior exposed through OmniLLM.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Provider type catalog
The system SHALL support distinct provider types for GitHub Copilot, Antigravity, Alibaba, ModelScope, Azure OpenAI, Google, Kimi, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Codex API keys, and OpenAI OAuth accounts.

#### Scenario: Distinct OpenAI modes
- **WHEN** provider types are listed
- **THEN** API-key Codex and OAuth OpenAI accounts remain distinct types

### Requirement: Provider instance registration

Every provider SHALL have a unique canonical instance identifier independent of
provider type, a non-empty display name, and an optional short alias. Registering
the same identifier SHALL replace its previous in-process registration. Provider
references MUST resolve in deterministic order by exact instance ID, unique
case-insensitive alias, then unique case-insensitive display name.

#### Scenario: Resolve exact instance ID

- **WHEN** a reference exactly equals a registered provider instance ID
- **THEN** that instance is returned without consulting alias or name matches

#### Scenario: Resolve unique alias

- **WHEN** no exact ID matches and exactly one provider alias matches the
  reference case-insensitively
- **THEN** that provider's canonical instance ID is returned

#### Scenario: Resolve unique display name

- **WHEN** no ID or alias matches and exactly one provider display name matches
  the reference case-insensitively
- **THEN** that provider's canonical instance ID is returned

#### Scenario: Ambiguous alias or display name

- **WHEN** the highest-precedence matching alias or display name belongs to more
  than one provider instance
- **THEN** resolution fails without selecting an instance and identifies the
  matching canonical instance IDs

#### Scenario: Unknown instance

- **WHEN** no instance ID, alias, or display name matches a provider reference
- **THEN** lookup fails without selecting an instance

#### Scenario: Legacy subtitle persistence

- **WHEN** an existing provider has a persisted `subtitle`
- **THEN** that value is treated as its alias without rewriting its instance ID,
  credentials, or owned records

### Requirement: Active provider selection
The registry SHALL maintain active instances and a primary active provider, promoting another active instance if the primary is removed.

#### Scenario: First activation
- **WHEN** the first instance is activated
- **THEN** it becomes the primary provider

### Requirement: Credential and configuration persistence
Provider authentication SHALL persist per-instance credentials and configuration so providers can be reconstructed after restart.

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible setup
- **WHEN** a valid endpoint and optional API key are configured
- **THEN** the normalized base URL, authentication type, display data, and token are stored for that instance

### Requirement: Secure compatible endpoints
OpenAI-compatible endpoints SHALL require an HTTP or HTTPS base URL, reject DashScope misclassification, and pass endpoint security validation before persistence and each model-discovery call.

#### Scenario: Invalid stored endpoint
- **WHEN** a stored endpoint fails security validation before model discovery
- **THEN** no upstream network request is made

### Requirement: Cached model discovery
The persisted model-list view SHALL use a per-instance and provider-type cache
with a 24-hour default TTL. Forced refresh SHALL bypass this view and any
provider-local catalog cache. Generation routing SHALL follow its separate bounded
freshness contract. Degraded discovery MUST NOT overwrite successful catalog data
or advance its successful-fetch timestamp.

#### Scenario: Provider type changes
- **WHEN** an instance identifier is reused for a different provider type
- **THEN** the old provider-type cache is not used

#### Scenario: Forced provider-local refresh
- **WHEN** an operator refreshes OpenAI models while its local successful cache is fresh
- **THEN** discovery attempts a live catalog fetch rather than returning the memoized catalog

#### Scenario: Fallback during discovery
- **WHEN** discovery returns a built-in or unavailable-endpoint fallback
- **THEN** callers can identify it as degraded and do not save it as new successful discovery

### Requirement: Model state overlay and degradation
Persisted enablement SHALL be applied to cached and fresh models, unknown states SHALL default enabled, duplicates SHALL collapse, and discovery failure SHALL fall back to persisted states when available.

#### Scenario: Discovery fails with stored states
- **WHEN** upstream discovery fails and model states exist
- **THEN** a model list is built from those stored identifiers and enablement values

### Requirement: Tool failures remain visible
A provider or proxy failure for a request containing tools SHALL return the underlying error and SHALL NOT retry the request after silently removing tools.

#### Scenario: Tool request fails
- **WHEN** upstream tool execution fails
- **THEN** the client receives the actual failure and no plain-chat retry is issued

### Requirement: Provider compatibility transforms
Provider adapters SHALL preserve gateway contracts while applying verified provider-specific execution, discovery, and serialization rules.

#### Scenario: Alibaba client streaming
- **WHEN** a streaming request routes to Alibaba
- **THEN** the upstream call executes non-streaming and the canonical result is re-streamed locally

#### Scenario: Alibaba Qwen 3.6 thinking flag
- **WHEN** an Alibaba Qwen 3.6 Plus request is constructed for plain chat, tool use, or a locally re-streamed response
- **THEN** its upstream thinking flag matches the supported Alibaba contract consistently across provider and server execution paths

#### Scenario: Alibaba live model metadata
- **WHEN** Alibaba live model discovery returns a known model identifier
- **THEN** provider model output applies the available metadata-enriched display name consistently

#### Scenario: Alibaba namespaced model identifier
- **WHEN** a request routes to Alibaba with a native upstream model identifier containing one or more slashes
- **THEN** Alibaba forwards the complete native model identifier without removing namespace segments

#### Scenario: DeepSeek V4 tool turn
- **WHEN** an Alibaba DeepSeek V4 request includes tools
- **THEN** upstream thinking is disabled and upstream `tool_choice` is omitted

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible tool history
- **WHEN** an assistant history message contains only tool calls
- **THEN** OpenAI-compatible serialization emits empty-string content with the tool calls

#### Scenario: Copilot GPT-5 family
- **WHEN** Copilot receives `gpt-5-mini`
- **THEN** it uses chat completions, while other GPT-5-family models may use Responses unless chat shape is forced

#### Scenario: Copilot tool-call stream
- **WHEN** Copilot interleaves indexed tool-call arguments or supplies first-chunk arguments
- **THEN** identifiers and arguments are accumulated by provider index and terminal stop is upgraded to tool use

#### Scenario: User identifier cap
- **WHEN** an OpenAI-compatible user identifier is oversized, including after extras merge
- **THEN** it is trimmed and capped before the upstream request

### Requirement: Copilot Claude response-header budget
GitHub Copilot Claude chat-completions requests SHALL use a dedicated configurable response-header timeout budget that is longer than the ordinary Copilot request budget, while model listing, embeddings, and non-Claude chat-completions SHALL retain the ordinary budget. Streaming response bodies SHALL remain unbounded after response headers arrive.

#### Scenario: Slow Claude response headers
- **WHEN** a Copilot Claude chat-completions request takes longer than the ordinary request budget but returns headers within the Claude budget
- **THEN** the request continues rather than failing at the ordinary timeout boundary

#### Scenario: Ordinary Copilot request
- **WHEN** a non-Claude chat-completions, model-list, or embeddings request is made
- **THEN** it uses the ordinary Copilot request timeout

#### Scenario: Claude budget exhausted
- **WHEN** a Copilot Claude request does not return headers within its configured budget
- **THEN** the attempt fails once and provider dispatch may proceed to its next candidate without an automatic duplicate request

### Requirement: Copilot timeout diagnostics
A Copilot upstream timeout SHALL emit one structured warning containing the provider instance, request identifier when available, canonical model, upstream endpoint, configured timeout budget, and elapsed duration, without including credentials or request content.

#### Scenario: Response-header timeout logged
- **WHEN** a Copilot request fails while awaiting response headers
- **THEN** the warning contains enough request, provider, endpoint, model, budget, and elapsed context to correlate the failure with the gateway request log

### Requirement: Copilot transient transport retry
GitHub Copilot chat-completions requests SHALL retry exactly once when the upstream attempt fails with a transient transport failure before any stream event has been emitted to the caller. A transient transport failure SHALL mean a connection-lost, connection-reset, or unexpected-EOF transport error, an HTTP/2 `INTERNAL_ERROR` stream reset, or an upstream response status of 502, 503, or 504. The retry SHALL be delayed by a short randomized interval. Timeout failures SHALL NOT be treated as transient transport failures, and no failure class SHALL be retried more than once.

#### Scenario: Connection lost before first event
- **WHEN** a Copilot streaming chat-completions request fails with a lost or reset connection before any stream event is emitted
- **THEN** the request is re-issued once after a randomized delay and the caller receives the successful retry result as a single uninterrupted stream

#### Scenario: Upstream service unavailable
- **WHEN** a Copilot chat-completions request receives upstream status 503 before any stream event is emitted
- **THEN** the request is re-issued once rather than failing the caller immediately

#### Scenario: Failure after first event
- **WHEN** a Copilot streaming request fails after at least one stream event has been emitted
- **THEN** no retry is attempted and the error surfaces to the caller, so already-delivered output is never duplicated

#### Scenario: Timeout is not retried
- **WHEN** a Copilot request fails by exceeding its configured response-header budget
- **THEN** the attempt fails once with no automatic duplicate request, preserving the existing timeout contract

#### Scenario: Retry also fails
- **WHEN** both the initial attempt and its single retry fail
- **THEN** the error from the final attempt is returned to provider dispatch, which may proceed to its next candidate

#### Scenario: Non-transient error
- **WHEN** a Copilot request fails with a non-transient error such as status 400 or an authentication failure
- **THEN** no transport retry is attempted and existing error handling applies unchanged

### Requirement: Copilot transport retry diagnostics
A Copilot transient transport retry SHALL emit one structured warning containing the provider instance, upstream endpoint, canonical model, attempt number, and the classification reason that triggered the retry, without including credentials or request content.

#### Scenario: Retry logged
- **WHEN** a Copilot request is retried after a transient transport failure
- **THEN** a single warning records the provider, endpoint, model, attempt number, and why the failure was classified as transient

### Requirement: Non-mutating diagnostic truncation
Truncating a request or response payload for diagnostic logging SHALL NOT modify or alias the caller's buffer. The truncated value SHALL be produced in newly allocated storage so that the payload subsequently transmitted upstream is byte-identical to the payload that was marshalled.

#### Scenario: Oversized payload is trace-logged
- **WHEN** a payload larger than the trace body limit is truncated for logging and the same buffer is then sent upstream
- **THEN** the transmitted bytes are unchanged and contain no truncation marker

#### Scenario: Payload within limit
- **WHEN** a payload at or below the trace body limit is truncated for logging
- **THEN** the value is returned unchanged and the caller's buffer is untouched

#### Scenario: Repeated truncation
- **WHEN** the same buffer is truncated for logging more than once
- **THEN** each result is identical and the source buffer remains unmodified

### Requirement: OAuth authorization-code provider compatibility
OpenAI and Antigravity OAuth authorization-code flows SHALL preserve their provider-specific authorization parameters, redirect URI behavior, token request encoding, refresh semantics, callback handling, and token processing when using shared protocol primitives.

#### Scenario: OpenAI authorization initiation
- **WHEN** an OpenAI OAuth authorization flow is started
- **THEN** the authorization request uses the fixed loopback redirect URI, S256 PKCE, the existing OpenAI scopes, and the existing OpenAI-specific authorization parameters

#### Scenario: OpenAI code exchange
- **WHEN** a validated OpenAI callback code is exchanged
- **THEN** the token request uses JSON encoding, the same fixed redirect URI, and the matching PKCE verifier

#### Scenario: Antigravity authorization initiation
- **WHEN** an Antigravity OAuth authorization flow is started
- **THEN** the authorization request uses the caller-derived callback URI, the existing Google scopes, offline access, consent prompting, and the generated state

#### Scenario: Antigravity code exchange
- **WHEN** a validated Antigravity callback code is exchanged
- **THEN** the token request uses form encoding and the exact redirect URI stored when authorization began

#### Scenario: Provider refresh compatibility
- **WHEN** OpenAI or Antigravity refreshes an access token
- **THEN** each provider preserves its existing request parameters, response handling, and refresh-token retention behavior

### Requirement: Concurrent Copilot shape metadata
GitHub Copilot model-shape metadata SHALL support concurrent model-list refresh and request-shape lookup without data races, map mutation hazards, or partially published metadata.

#### Scenario: Model discovery overlaps request routing
- **WHEN** a successful Copilot model-list refresh publishes shape metadata while requests concurrently select an upstream API shape
- **THEN** each request observes either the previous complete snapshot or the new complete snapshot and shape selection remains valid

#### Scenario: Shape metadata is unavailable
- **WHEN** no complete shape snapshot has been published for a model
- **THEN** the existing model-family fallback determines the request shape

### Requirement: Copilot Responses custom-tool fidelity
The Copilot Responses adapter SHALL preserve native custom tool definitions, call history, results, provider output, raw input streaming, names, ordering, and call identifiers without coercing custom tools to function calls.

#### Scenario: Custom definition and history request
- **WHEN** a canonical request contains a custom tool or prior custom call/result
- **THEN** Copilot receives native custom tool definitions and custom call/output items with the preserved format, raw values, name, and `call_id`

#### Scenario: Non-streaming provider custom call
- **WHEN** Copilot returns a `custom_tool_call`
- **THEN** canonical output preserves the custom kind, name, identifier, namespace, exact raw input, and tool-use stop reason

#### Scenario: Streaming provider custom call
- **WHEN** Copilot streams custom output items and interleaved custom-input deltas
- **THEN** canonical stream events retain each call's index, identity, order, and raw input without duplicate done content or cross-association

#### Scenario: Non-Responses provider fallback
- **WHEN** a custom tool request is handled by a provider path without native custom-tool support
- **THEN** the adapter may use the retained function-compatible schema, arguments, and result text without changing existing function-tool behavior

### Requirement: Copilot advertised-model execution contract
GitHub Copilot models SHALL be discovered from the authenticated Copilot catalog and SHALL execute through a supported upstream API shape advertised for that model while preserving compatible generation, streaming, system-instruction, and tool-use semantics.

#### Scenario: Grok catalog discovery
- **WHEN** the authenticated Copilot catalog advertises a Grok model with capabilities and supported endpoints
- **THEN** OmniLLM exposes that exact model identifier and capability metadata and selects one of its advertised upstream API shapes

#### Scenario: Grok request through supported gateway shapes
- **WHEN** Chat Completions, Messages, or Responses input routes to an advertised Copilot Grok model
- **THEN** the Copilot adapter preserves the request's system instructions, conversation and tool history, and returns the requested gateway envelope with a valid terminal result

#### Scenario: Provider-pinned Grok request
- **WHEN** a Copilot Grok request is pinned through a provider-qualified or virtual-model route
- **THEN** endpoint selection remains consistent with the authenticated model catalog rather than falling back solely from the model name

#### Scenario: Grok stream cancellation
- **WHEN** the caller cancels a streaming Copilot Grok request
- **THEN** the in-flight upstream request is cancelled without a second upstream execution or duplicate downstream output

### Requirement: OpenAI-compatible prompt-cache modes
An OpenAI-compatible provider instance SHALL support persisted prompt-cache modes `auto`, `disabled`, `openai_native`, and `anthropic_inline`; `auto` SHALL resolve official `api.openai.com` endpoints to `openai_native` and all other endpoints to `disabled`.

#### Scenario: Existing custom endpoint
- **WHEN** an existing custom OpenAI-compatible provider has no prompt-cache mode configured
- **THEN** it remains usable and omits prompt-cache request metadata by default

#### Scenario: Official OpenAI safety
- **WHEN** an operator attempts to configure `anthropic_inline` for an official OpenAI endpoint
- **THEN** configuration is rejected before a request can send unsupported fields upstream

### Requirement: Native OpenAI request controls
Official OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions and Responses requests in native mode SHALL omit Anthropic-style `cache_control` fields and SHALL forward supplied native prompt cache key and retention values on supported upstream shapes.

#### Scenario: Anthropic inbound request reaches official OpenAI
- **WHEN** an Anthropic Messages request carrying explicit breakpoints routes to official OpenAI without native OpenAI hints
- **THEN** the OpenAI payload omits the markers and retains the same prompt content and tool history

#### Scenario: Native cache hints reach official OpenAI
- **WHEN** a Chat Completions or Responses request supplies native cache key or retention values and routes to official OpenAI
- **THEN** the matching upstream request includes those values unchanged

### Requirement: Opt-in compatible inline controls
A custom OpenAI-compatible instance configured for `anthropic_inline` SHALL preserve cache controls at their canonical system, message-content, tool-result, tool-definition, and top-level placements without reordering prompt content or adding breakpoints.

#### Scenario: Compatible inline payload
- **WHEN** a marked request routes to an explicitly inline-compatible custom instance
- **THEN** the upstream payload contains the same number, TTLs, relative placements, and ordering of cache controls represented by CIF

### Requirement: Unsupported-provider omission
Providers without a verified request-control contract SHALL omit prompt-cache directives while preserving all generation-affecting content and SHALL NOT retry after removing cache controls in response to an upstream error.

#### Scenario: Unsupported provider rejects request for another reason
- **WHEN** a provider receives a prompt whose cache metadata was intentionally omitted and the upstream returns an error
- **THEN** existing error and failover behavior applies without a second cache-stripped retry

### Requirement: Provider cache usage parsing
Provider adapters SHALL normalize standard cached-input counters from Chat Completions, Responses, and Gemini usage metadata when those counters are present in non-streaming or final streaming usage.

#### Scenario: Implicit Gemini cache read
- **WHEN** a Gemini response reports `cachedContentTokenCount`
- **THEN** canonical usage records that value as cache-read input without claiming that OmniLLM created a managed cached-content resource

#### Scenario: Missing cache detail
- **WHEN** a provider reports aggregate input usage without a cache counter
- **THEN** the adapter preserves aggregate input and leaves cache detail unknown rather than reporting a zero-valued hit

### Requirement: Deferred provider cache protocols
The system SHALL NOT claim native Anthropic, Bedrock cache-point, or Gemini managed cached-content request support until the corresponding upstream provider protocol and lifecycle are implemented and tested.

#### Scenario: Provider catalog lacks deferred protocol
- **WHEN** provider capabilities are reported for the current release
- **THEN** native Anthropic, Bedrock, and Gemini managed-cache request support are absent rather than inferred from inbound dialect compatibility

### Requirement: OpenAI refresh-token rotation recovery

The OpenAI ChatGPT-OAuth provider SHALL decode standard and nested token
endpoint errors without logging raw credential-response bodies, SHALL recover a
rejected single-use refresh token by retrying at most once with a different
newer token from provider-owned durable state, and MUST stop automatically
retrying a rejected token when no newer durable token exists.

#### Scenario: Newer durable refresh token

- **WHEN** an OpenAI refresh token is rejected as already used and the durable
  provider record contains a different non-empty refresh token
- **THEN** the provider adopts that token, retries the exchange once, and
  persists the successful rotated token set

#### Scenario: No newer durable refresh token

- **WHEN** an OpenAI refresh token is rejected as already used and durable state
  contains no different refresh token
- **THEN** the provider retains its existing access token, durably retires the
  rejected refresh token, returns browser sign-in guidance, and makes no
  automatic refresh request with that rejected token later

#### Scenario: Nested token endpoint error

- **WHEN** OpenAI returns a nested JSON error object from the token endpoint
- **THEN** the provider returns a sanitized error containing actionable type,
  code, and message fields without including a raw response-body preview

#### Scenario: Concurrent refresh callers

- **WHEN** concurrent requests on one provider instance require refresh
- **THEN** they share the bounded refresh operation and do not independently
  consume the same single-use token

### Requirement: Bounded OpenAI last-good catalog recovery
OpenAI OAuth SHALL reuse its last successful catalog for at most one hour from
the original successful fetch during transient network, HTTP 429, or HTTP 5xx
discovery failures. Stale reuse SHALL NOT reset successful-fetch time. Authentication
failure or account/configuration invalidation MUST prevent reuse of obsolete
authorization-scoped data. Built-in fallback SHALL remain explicitly degraded.

#### Scenario: Expired catalog and temporary outage
- **WHEN** a 15-minute-old OpenAI catalog contains Astra and refresh returns HTTP 503
- **THEN** Astra remains discoverable from the bounded last-good snapshot and a later request retries after backoff

#### Scenario: Maximum stale age exceeded
- **WHEN** no successful OpenAI catalog fetch has occurred for more than one hour
- **THEN** the expired snapshot is no longer offered as last-good availability

#### Scenario: Different account
- **WHEN** OpenAI re-authentication changes the account behind an instance
- **THEN** discovery cannot reuse the previous account's catalog

### Requirement: Exact OpenAI model preservation during catalog degradation
The OpenAI adapter SHALL preserve explicitly routed model identifiers when absent
from a degraded catalog. Compatibility remapping SHALL be limited to explicit
legacy mappings and MUST NOT substitute a catalog default for arbitrary unknown
GPT-family model identifiers.

#### Scenario: New model absent from fallback
- **WHEN** a selected or pinned OpenAI request names `gpt-6-astra` and discovery degrades to an older built-in list
- **THEN** upstream generation receives `gpt-6-astra` unchanged

#### Scenario: Unsupported explicit model
- **WHEN** a pinned request uses an unknown identifier without an explicit compatibility mapping
- **THEN** the identifier reaches upstream unchanged and an upstream rejection remains visible

#### Scenario: Explicit legacy mapping
- **WHEN** a model matches an explicitly retained legacy compatibility mapping
- **THEN** the adapter applies that mapping consistently regardless of catalog ordering
