# admin-api Specification

## Purpose
Defines the HTTP administration surface used to operate OmniLLM providers, virtual models, settings, metering, sessions, access tokens, and external tool configuration.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Administrative authentication
The system SHALL protect `/api/admin` endpoints with bearer or `x-api-key` authentication except for explicitly public information and OAuth flow endpoints.

#### Scenario: Protected request without credentials
- **WHEN** a client calls a protected admin endpoint without a valid credential
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 401 and does not invoke the handler

#### Scenario: Public information request
- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /api/admin/info` without credentials
- **THEN** the system returns server version, port, backend, uptime, and authentication status

### Requirement: Provider lifecycle management

The system SHALL expose authenticated operations to list, log in or
re-authenticate, configure, prioritize, activate, deactivate, rename, and delete
provider instances and to manage their model catalogs. Provider-scoped
operations MUST accept a provider reference resolved from instance ID, alias, or
display name, and the normalized login operation MUST support both new-instance
authentication by provider type and existing-instance re-authentication.

#### Scenario: Normalized immediate login

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator submits credentials that can be validated
  synchronously for a supported new provider type or existing provider reference
- **THEN** the login operation returns a common completed result containing the
  canonical provider instance ID and whether the instance was newly created

#### Scenario: Normalized interactive login

- **WHEN** authentication requires browser or device authorization
- **THEN** the login operation returns a common pending result containing the
  canonical provider instance ID, authorization instructions, and a flow token
  usable with one status operation until completion, failure, cancellation, or
  expiry

#### Scenario: Existing-provider re-authentication

- **WHEN** a login target resolves to an existing provider by ID, alias, or name
- **THEN** successful authentication updates that instance's credentials and
  preserves its canonical ID, alias, display name, activation, priority, and
  model configuration

#### Scenario: Failed new-provider login

- **WHEN** authentication or persistence fails after a new provider instance is
  reserved
- **THEN** the reserved parent and its owned partial records are removed

#### Scenario: Failed existing-provider login

- **WHEN** re-authentication of an existing provider fails
- **THEN** the existing provider instance and its prior durable metadata are not
  deleted

#### Scenario: Provider reference in lifecycle operation

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator supplies a unique provider alias or display
  name to a provider-scoped lifecycle or model-catalog operation
- **THEN** the operation applies to the resolved canonical instance ID and the
  response identifies that ID

#### Scenario: Legacy authentication endpoint

- **WHEN** an existing client uses a previous create, re-authentication, OAuth
  start, callback, or status endpoint
- **THEN** the existing request and response contract remains available

#### Scenario: Provider list identity fields

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator lists provider instances
- **THEN** every item contains its canonical `id`, display `name`, canonical
  `alias`, and the compatibility `subtitle` value equal to `alias`

#### Scenario: Provider metadata update

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator updates `alias` or the compatibility field
  `subtitle`
- **THEN** the same persisted alias is updated and returned as both fields

#### Scenario: Provider deactivation

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator deactivates an existing provider
- **THEN** the provider is excluded from the active provider set

#### Scenario: Model catalog refresh

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator requests a provider model refresh
- **THEN** the provider cache is bypassed and the persisted model view is updated

### Requirement: Runtime status and settings
The system SHALL report active providers and enabled model counts and SHALL allow authenticated operators to manage runtime log level and Redis-backed response-cache settings, statistics, availability, and namespace-scoped clearing. The response-cache settings response SHALL preserve its existing fields and add live payload bytes, namespace lookup-hit and lookup-miss counts, lookup hit rate, and statistics-window start without exposing Redis credentials.

#### Scenario: Runtime log-level update
- **WHEN** an authenticated operator sets a supported log level
- **THEN** the level takes effect without a restart and is returned by the settings endpoint

#### Scenario: Cache settings response
- **WHEN** an authenticated operator reads response-cache settings
- **THEN** the response includes enabled, TTL, backend, availability, entry count, compatibility total hits, live payload bytes, lookup hits, lookup misses, lookup hit rate, and statistics-window start

#### Scenario: Cache statistics unavailable
- **WHEN** Redis statistics cannot be read
- **THEN** the endpoint returns HTTP 200 with durable settings, zero numeric statistics, null lookup hit rate and statistics-window start, backend marked unavailable, and no Redis credentials

#### Scenario: Cache clear
- **WHEN** an authenticated operator clears the response cache while Redis is available
- **THEN** only response entries and statistics in the configured OmniLLM namespace are removed and success with the removed entry count is reported

#### Scenario: Cache clear unavailable
- **WHEN** an authenticated operator clears the response cache while Redis is unavailable
- **THEN** the endpoint returns a server error and does not claim that cached entries or statistics were removed

### Requirement: Virtual model management
The system SHALL provide authenticated create, read, update, rename, list, and delete operations for virtual models and their upstream definitions.

#### Scenario: Invalid virtual model
- **WHEN** a create request omits its identifier, name, or an upstream model identifier
- **THEN** the system rejects the request with HTTP 400 without persisting it

### Requirement: Metering and log access
The system SHALL expose authenticated raw and aggregate metering views with model, provider, client, API-shape, time, and provider prompt-cache filters, including nullable cache token detail and derived `hit`, `miss`, or `unknown` prompt-cache status, plus a server-sent-event stream of live logs.

#### Scenario: Filtered metering query
- **WHEN** a metering request supplies supported dimension, time, or prompt-cache-status filters
- **THEN** only matching request records contribute to the response

#### Scenario: Raw metering cache detail
- **WHEN** a raw metering row is returned
- **THEN** it includes nullable uncached, cache-read, cache-write, five-minute-write, and one-hour-write token fields and its derived prompt-cache status

#### Scenario: Aggregate metering cache detail
- **WHEN** an aggregate metering endpoint is requested
- **THEN** it includes cache token totals and hit, miss, and unknown request counts for the selected window or grouping

#### Scenario: Live log subscription
- **WHEN** an authenticated client opens the log stream
- **THEN** the connection remains open and receives newly emitted log events

### Requirement: Chat session management
The system SHALL provide authenticated operations to create, list, read, update, append messages to, and delete stored chat sessions.

#### Scenario: Delete all sessions
- **WHEN** an authenticated operator deletes the chat-session collection
- **THEN** subsequent session listing returns an empty collection

### Requirement: Access token administration
The system SHALL create, list, and revoke access tokens while storing only token hashes and returning a new plaintext token only when it is created.

#### Scenario: Revoked access token
- **WHEN** an operator deletes an access token and it is presented on a later request
- **THEN** authentication rejects the token

### Requirement: External tool configuration management
The system SHALL list, read, write, import, and back up supported external tool configuration files only when privileged configuration editing is enabled.

#### Scenario: Configuration editing disabled
- **WHEN** a client attempts to write or import a configuration while editing is disabled
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 403 without modifying the file

#### Scenario: Malformed structured configuration
- **WHEN** JSON-backed tool configuration content is invalid JSON
- **THEN** the system responds with HTTP 400 and preserves the existing file

#### Scenario: Secure configuration write
- **WHEN** valid configuration is written for a known tool
- **THEN** parent directories and the file are created with owner-only permissions

### Requirement: Bounded configuration imports
The administration API SHALL enforce a finite upload limit before parsing multipart configuration imports and SHALL return HTTP 413 without modifying the target file when the request or uploaded configuration exceeds that limit.

#### Scenario: Configuration upload exceeds the limit
- **WHEN** an authenticated operator uploads a configuration larger than the configured import limit
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 413 and preserves the existing target file

#### Scenario: Configuration upload remains within the limit
- **WHEN** an authenticated operator uploads a valid configuration at or below the configured import limit
- **THEN** the existing validation and secure-write behavior applies unchanged

### Requirement: Model refresh updates generation availability
A successful authenticated provider model refresh SHALL bypass persisted and
provider-local catalog caches and replace or invalidate the corresponding
generation routing snapshot before returning. Failed or degraded refresh MUST NOT
overwrite last successful catalog data with fallback data or claim fresh discovery.

#### Scenario: Refresh discovers Astra
- **WHEN** routing holds an old catalog without Astra and an authenticated refresh successfully discovers it
- **THEN** a subsequent generation request can resolve Astra without restarting OmniLLM

#### Scenario: Refresh removes model
- **WHEN** a successful authoritative refresh omits a model from the previous catalog
- **THEN** ordinary generation resolution no longer uses that obsolete snapshot to select the provider

#### Scenario: Refresh fails
- **WHEN** a forced refresh receives a transient discovery failure and has fallback display data
- **THEN** fallback display handling does not overwrite successful catalog data or advance its freshness

#### Scenario: Concurrent stale fetch
- **WHEN** a pre-refresh fetch completes after successful admin refresh
- **THEN** it cannot replace the refreshed generation snapshot with its older catalog
