## Test Infrastructure

### Comprehensive Mocking
- **Fetch API** - Intercepted and routed to mock responses
- **EventSource** - Real-time log streaming mocks
- **WebSocket** - For future streaming features
- **localStorage/sessionStorage** - Storage mocks
- **State management** - Mock setup/teardown

### Mock Data
- 3 providers (GitHub Copilot, Alibaba, Azure)
- 4 models across vendors
- 3 chat sessions with messages
- All API response formats (OpenAI, Anthropic, Responses)
- Usage quotas with snapshots
- Log data and auth flows

### Test Utilities
- `setupFetchMocks()` - API interception
- `EventSourceMock` - Real-time streaming
- Mock builders for all entities
- Environment setup/cleanup helpers
